    Building Open Source Network Security Tools Sample Code

    UPDATE

    The 1.0.1 has the following updates over the 1.0 release:

    - Sift 1.1 maintenence release:
      - Moved the host resolution function call to the beginning of
        build_packet() to catch non-resolvers before we actually build part
        of the packet.
      - Sift erroneously ignored ASCII 0x20 (space characters)
      - Sift was not stepping over the proper number of bytes when skipping
        over certain header information (it was off by one).
      - A SNAPLEN of 150 bytes was too short.  I've increased this to 350
        bytes which is sufficient.
      - Changed the timeout character from * to <sift_time_out> this reduces
        the false negatives we'd get from a DNS server with a version string
        of "*".

    - Addition of "stroker_ace.c" oui.txt manipulation program:
      - stroker_ace will take a vanilla oui.txt file from IEEE and convert
        it into a header file to be compiled into the stroke program.
