    Building Open Source Network Security Tools Sample Code

    README

    The following 11 examples correspond with chapters in the Wiley book
    Building Open Source Network Security Tools.  If you have this tarball
    but not the book, this code will be of limited value to you.  I urge
    you to purchase the book to understand the model after which these tools
    are patterned.  The book's main URL is:

    Stroke          - libpcap component sample code
    Punch           - libnet component sample code
    Lilt            - libnids component sample code
    Legerdemain     - libsf component sample code
    Clutch          - libdnet component sample code
    Roil            - openssl component sample code
    Scoop           - passive reconaissance technique sample code
    Knock           - active reconaissance technique sample code
    Sift            - attack and penetration technique sample code
    Descry          - defensive technique sample code
    Firewalk        - "the tool"

    Note that since Lilt is built on top of the libnids-1.16 component
    which is in turn built on top of the libnet-1.0.x component, it
    requires the older 1.0.x version of libnet to be installed on the
    system.  All of the other programs that use libnet require the newer
    more robust version 1.1.0 (the version covered in the book).
